1. Validate the Helformer prediction method
            RMSE       MAPE       MAE
Helformer   8.0665     0.010%     3.7670 (Paper)
Test        44.9076    0.0665%  39.2340(Our validation)
conclusion: difficult to use the current Helformer project.
            lack of dataset
            one type feature used
            impossible seasonal prediction 

2. Research the method to improve the performance of Helformer.
method: used multi-input features, not reflect the seasonal trend
result: 
ModelType   RMSE       MAPE       MAE
Helformer   8.0665      0.010%     3.7670 (Paper)

conclusion: must reflect the seasonal trend
            optimize the hyper-params of Helformer
            sufficient dataset with various features
